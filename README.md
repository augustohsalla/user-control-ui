# User Control Assessment
User story 
As an anonymous user I want to manage a set of users in a table. In addition I want to be able to have an input field which filters the list of users for matching criteria e.g. enter the name of a user “Franz” or “Fra” into the input field and the list updates to reflect only the matching users with name “Franz”.

## Acceptance criteria
 - Create a Backend in .NET Core to manage (Add, remove, update and
   search) users.
 - The username and e-mail fields should be unique
 - Display name, username, email and website
 -  React on front end - web api developed using .net core.
 -  create-react-app
